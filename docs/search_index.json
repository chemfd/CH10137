Thermodynamics is fundamental to the way we live, to our dream of living a better, less impactful life and to how we as ‘life’ work. 1.2 State functions - (products - reactants) Many properties in thermodynamics are state functions, that is properties that only depend upon the current state of the system. State functions are completely independent of the path by which that final state was reached. Enthalpy (H) is a state function, as are entropy (S), internal energy (U), Gibbs’ free energy (G), Helmholtz free energy (F), temperature (T), pressure (p), and chemical composition. Path functions are unlike state functions in that they depend on the path taken to determine their value. Heat (q) and work (w) are both examples of path functions. Internal energy, U The internal energy is the sum of all of the kinetic and potential energy contributions of the molecules in the system. Enthalpy, H The enthalpy is related to the internal energy, but also takes into account any expansion work done by the system, formally ΔH = ΔU + Δ(pV). Entropy, S The entropy is a measure of the number of possible arrangements of a system (multiplicity, Ω), formally S = kB ln Ω Gibbs’ free energy, G The Gibbs’ free energy is a measure of the energy available to ‘do work’ in a reaction system. It accounts for both the enalpic and entropic contributions of the reaction. ΔG = ΔH − TΔS Figure 1.1: State functions - no matter how you got here, here you are… …altitude is a good analogy for a state function, whether climbing the mountain or flying on the balloon if your altitude is 1000 m it is 1000 m!. 1.2.1 Useful equations - State functions Hess’ Law (Equation (1.1)) is something most will be familiar with already. You should try to think about it in terms of an equation however, not the cylces of which you may already be familiar. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta_r H^{\\ominus} = \\sum_{products}v \\Delta H^{\\ominus}_\\textrm{X}-\\sum_{reactants}v \\Delta H^{\\ominus}_\\textrm{X} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] Similar equations can be used for heat capacity (Equation (1.2)), this equation for heat capacity will then be used later in the course when we look at the effect of temperature on the enthalpy and entropy of reaction. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta_r C_p^{\\ominus} = \\sum_{products}vC_{p,n}^{\\ominus}-\\sum_{reactants}vC_{p,n}^{\\ominus} \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] Entropy, just like enthalpy is a state function. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta_r S^{\\ominus} = \\sum_{products}v S^{\\ominus}-\\sum_{reactants}v S^{\\ominus} \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] As is Gibbs’ free energy. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta _ r G^\\ominus = \\sum_{prod} v G_n^\\ominus - \\sum_{react} v G_n^\\ominus \\tag{1.4} \\end{equation}\\] The value of each of these variables is independent of the path used to form them. Hence, the same ‘products − reactants’ approach always works! 1.3 Types of thermodynamic system When we consider anything in thermodynamics we have to consider both the system and its surroundings. The relationship between the system and the surroundings defines the different types of thermodynamic system. 1.3.1 Isolated system Figure 1.2: Isolated system: there is no exchange of matter or energy between the system and surroundings. In an isolated system, there can be no exchange of either matter or energy in any form between the system and surroundings. A stoppered perfectly insulated flask may be thought of as an isolated system. 1.3.2 Open system Figure 1.3: Open system: in an open system both matter and energy may be exchanged between the system and surroundings. In an open system both matter and energy can be exchanged between the system and surroundings. A cup of tea is a nice example of an open system you can add sugar (if you are weird), drink it, or forget about it and find it cold 2 hours later. 1.3.3 Closed system Figure 1.4: Closed system: in a closed system only energy in either the form of heat or work may be exchanged between system and surroundings.. A closed system is one where you can’t exchange matter but energy in the form of either ‘heat’ or ‘work’ can be exchanged between the system and surroundings. A closed system is often used as a simpler model than an open system - not many things in life actually fit this model perfectly, but most bench chemistry where we can heat a system fits into this model. 1.3.4 Adiabatic system Figure 1.5: Adiabatic system: in an adiabatic system only energy in the form of work may be exchanged between the system and surroundings. An adiabatic system is one where you can’t have any flow of heat between the system and surroundings, but you can exchange energy in the form of work. This would mean that the system is insulated from the surroundings, and therefore the system may not be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the surroundings. We will learn more about both ‘heat’ and ‘work’ later in the course. 1.4 Extensive and intensive properties The difference between extensive and intensive properties is whether the property depends upon the amount of ‘stuff’ you have. 1.4.1 Intensive properties Properties which are independent of the amount of stuff are called ‘intensive properties’. Temperature is an example of an intensive property as are all of ‘molar’ properties (the quantity of something ‘per mole’): molar heat capacity, molar enthalpy, molar entropy, molar Gibbs’ energy, etc… in physics the term ‘specific’ is often used such as specific heat capacity and specific enthalpy, these are also intensive properties based on the fixed amount of a ‘gram’ (g). 1.4.2 Extensive properties Conversely, properties which are dependent on the amount of stuff you have are called extensive properties. Many intensive properties have extensive equivalents, so whilst we have ‘molar heat capacity’ we also have ‘heat capacity’; one looks at the amount of energy it takes to raise one mole of a thing by one kelvin, whereas the other looks at how much energy it takes to raise the temperature how ever much of a thing we have by on kelvin. Consequently extensive properties have different units to their ‘equivalent’ intensive property. Other examples of extensive properties are unsurprisingly: volume, mass, amount (as in moles), and length. Whilst knowing the terms extensive and intensive isn’t vital it is hugely important to recognise that sometimes terms will appear with different units to suit the particular situation. 1.5 Classical vs. Statistical thermodynamics Thermodynamics is quite an old subject, much of our understanding of why chemical reactions happen is based in 19th century science. This understanding was based on emperical observation of things like steam engines and battery piles. It scientists trying to understand how things work in order to make them better, make them more efficient, and make them safer. This 19th century (and earlier) view of the world didn’t even consider things we take for granted now, nowhere in thermodynamics do we ever really think about atoms. We talk about ideal systems (those that follow the rules nicely), but never really care about the reaction taking place, it is all just the bulk average behaviour of the system. Then in the late 19th century Ludwig Boltzmann proposed a different way of thinking about thermodynamics. He started to think about the ‘average’ behaviour of individual atoms. This version of statistical mechanics gave an explanation of what concepts like entropy were and it helped explain macroscopic phenomena (such as pressure and temperature) on an atomic and molecular level. Statistical thermodynamics started to be able to explain the values of what had until then been emperical constants. Consequently in this course we will look at thermodynamics from both a classical and statistical point of view. 1.6 Example calculations 1.6.1 Example calculation - Hess’s Law How much energy is released when 4.60 g of sodium reacts with excess water to give NaOH (aq) &amp; H2 (g)? ΔHf⦵ NaOH = −425.61 kJ mol−1 ΔHf⦵ H2O = −285.83 kJ mol−1 The enthalpy of formation of elements in their standard state (e.g. Na (s) &amp; H2 (g)) is zero. Therefore using equation (1.1): \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Delta H_{rxn}^{\\ominus}= \\Delta H_{f}^{\\ominus}(\\textrm{NaOH})-\\Delta H_{f}^{\\ominus}(\\textrm{H}_2\\textrm{O})= −425.61 \\textrm{ kJ mol}^{−1} − −285.83 \\textrm{ kJ mol}^{−1} = −139.78 \\textrm{ kJ mol}^{−1} \\end{equation*}\\] \\(R_M \\textrm{ Na} = 22.989769 \\textrm{ g mol}^{−1}\\) Therefore: \\[\\begin{equation*} n \\textrm{(Na)} = \\frac{m}{R_M} = \\frac{4.60 \\textrm{ g}}{ 22.989769 \\textrm{ g mol}^{−1}} = 0.200 \\textrm{ mol} \\end{equation*}\\] note sf! Therefore if 4.60g reacts: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Delta H_{rxn}^⦵ ( \\textrm{kJ}) = \\Delta H_{rxn}^⦵ ( \\textrm{kJ mol}^{−1}) × \\textrm{mol} = −139.78 \\textrm{kJ mol}^{-1} × 0.200 \\textrm{mol} = −28.0 \\textrm{ kJ} \\end{equation*}\\] The ‘−’ sign indicates that heat is released (evolved) and the temperature of the surroundings increases. 1.6.2 Example Calculation - Kirchoff’s law Kirchoff’s laws may be used to adjust calculated values of enthalpy and entropy of reaction to different temperatures, they use the difference in heat capacity of products and reactants to do this. Determine \\(ΔC_{p,m}\\) for the following reaction: CH3CH2OH (aq) + CH3COOH (aq) ⟶ CH3COOCH2CH3 (aq) + H2O (l) \\(ΔC_{p,m}\\) / J K\\(^{−1}\\) mol\\(^{−1}\\) CH3CH2OH (aq) 111.46 CH3COOH (aq) 124.3 CH3COOCH2CH3 (aq) 170.1 H2O (l) 33.58 \\[\\begin{equation*} ΔC_{p,m \\textrm{ rxn}} = (C_{p,m} \\textrm{CH$_3$COOCH$_2$CH$_3$ (aq)} + C_{p,m} \\textrm{H$_2$O (l)}) − (C_{p,m} \\textrm{CH$_3$CH$_2$OH (aq)} + C_{p,m} \\textrm{CH$_3$COOH (aq)}) \\end{equation*}\\] \\[\\begin{equation*} ΔC_\\textrm{p,m rxn} = (170.1 + 33.58) − (111.46 + 124.3) \\textrm{ J K$^{-1}$ mol}^{−1}) = − 32.1 \\textrm{ J K$^{-1}$ mol}^{−1} \\end{equation*}\\] 1.7 Questions Later in this course you will learn about the origin of these equations, for now it is enough to be able to balance chemical equations and use the fact that each of the variables in teh following equations are state functions.

["ch-Part2.html", "CH101372 Week 1 - Part 2 2.1 Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics 2.2 What is temperature? 2.3 Internal energy, U", " CH101372 Week 1 - Part 2 There are different methods of teaching thermodynamics, many come at the problem from a very mathematical viewpoint, with partial derivatives, and operators. This course does not do that, the emphasis here is on understanding thermodynamic concepts, and being able to apply them solve problems. At no point will I expect you to be able to derive something, and I only include the derivations of a couple of equations where I feel it aids understanding of the concept. If you wish to see a more mathematical version of this course it is covered in a number of textbooks, including the recommended text for this course, Atkin’s Elements of Physical Chemistry. 2.1 Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics There are four laws of thermodynamics, each introduces a thermodynamic concept. The first of these laws was actually the last to be defined and is called the zeroth law. The zeroth law deals with the idea of thermal equilibrium, and leads to the concept of temperature. Figure 2.1: The zeroth law of thermodynamics states: if A is in thermal equilibrium with B, and B is in thermal equilibrium with C, then C will be in thermal equilibrium with A. The thermal equilibrium used in figure @(fig:zerothlaw) basically says that if A and B are in thermal equilibrium then they must have the same temperature. Therefore the first thermodynamic concept we meet is temperature, which has the unit K (kelvin). The following video is for context and interest only 2.2 What is temperature? You are already familiar with teh Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and have seen that the mean speed of a gas particle depends only upon the mass of that particle and the temperature (figure 2.2). Figure 2.2: The distribution of speeds of a gas depends only upon temperature and molecular mass. At low temperatures the mean speeds of particles are lower than those at high temperatures. Therefore there is fundamental link between ‘speed’ and temperature. In Section 1.5 you were introduced to the concept of energy levels in molecules. If you recall all energy levels are quantised, and translational energy levels have the closest spacing (figure 2.3). The faster a molecule moves the higher the translational energy level it occupies. Figure 2.3: The energy levels within molecules have different gaps between levels, translational levels are very closely spaced, rotational energy levels have the next closest spacing, vibrational levels are higher in energy still, finally electronic levels have the largest energy gaps. The relative populations of these energy levels is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{N_i}{N_j}=\\frac{g_i}{g_j} \\textrm{e}^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Looking at equation (2.1) we can see that the relative population of energy levels depends upon ΔE, the energy gap between them. This means that the closely spaced translational energy levels are well populated and the particles have a range of speeds associated with this. At very low temperatures only translational levels are populated, but as the temperature increases and the energy is distributed over more levels rotational levels are then populated, then finally vibrational, at room temperature only there is only a negligible probability of vibrational energy levels being populated. Figure 2.4: As the temperature is decreased the probability of finding particles in the ground translational state increases. At absolute zero all molecules will be in the ground translational state. Therefore temperature is a measure of the population of energy levels within a molecule. 2.3 Internal energy, U Internal energy is a state function, which describes the ‘total internal energy’ of a system. We are already aware that there is thermal energy within the system from the population of the energy levels as described in figure 2.3. However internal energy also accounts for the ‘potential energy’ from the interactions between particles in the system (figure 2.5). Figure 2.5: The internal energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the particles in the system. THIS DOCUMENT IS UNFINISHED "],
